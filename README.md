# Port experiments

A test bench for group authority, key agreement, replication and delivery.
The same scenarios run against several candidate stacks; from what each
candidate needs from the app we derive the ports of the Real Life Trust
Protocol. The findings per candidate live here in
`src/candidates/*/NOTES.md`; the plan and its reasoning in the private
workshop repository (`rltp/design/port-experimente-2026-10.md`).

## Results

- **The conformance matrix**, interactive: 53 promises across four ports
  (group candidates in the authority, key and replication ports, multi-device
  candidates in the multi-device port), every cell with its scenarios and
  the recorded result:
  https://real-life.org/port-experimente/matrix.html. The page and the
  Markdown matrix (`matrix.md`) are both written by
  `REPORT=1 pnpm vitest run report` (`src/lab/matrix-page.ts`; the English
  text of ports, promises, scenarios and candidates in `src/lab/matrix-en.ts`,
  a test fails when one is missing); never edit `public/matrix.html` by
  hand. The browser page
  renders it at the end of a run.
- **How to read it.** A promise is kept only if every scenario mapped to it
  passes. "Not applicable" means the candidate has no capability for the
  scenario, or the carrier fault never touched a frame of that kind. That
  is a gap in coverage, never a pass.
- **Every branch.** A cell is kept only if it holds in every branch.
  Where a candidate decides by chance (two concurrent MLS commits: the
  smaller hash wins), the bench forces each side of every such decision and
  runs the scenario in all branches (`src/lab/zweige.ts`); where a result
  depends on delivery time (the Subduction server in `keyhive-ark`), the
  scenario runs several times and the bench reports the distribution
  against a bound the candidate derives from its own parameters
  (`src/lab/zeit.ts`). A cell that holds only sometimes is not kept, and
  its result says what it depends on ("abhängig von …"). There is no
  "nondeterministic" marker and no oracle is widened to make a run pass.
- The bench itself speaks German: scenario titles, status lines and the
  recorded results are German strings in the code. The notes and this
  README are English.

## Candidates

| Id | What | Transport class |
|---|---|---|
| `gen2` | WoT generation 2 (`@web_of_trust/core` 0.6.0, Yjs, own relay in process) | own server |
| `p2panda` | p2panda-spaces 0.7.1 (WebAssembly) | bench relay |
| `keyhive` | Keyhive 0.3.0-alpha.1 (WebAssembly, content in Yjs) | bench relay |
| `keyhive-ark` | Keyhive over ARK 0.6.0-alpha.1 (Automerge, Subduction server) | own server, Node only |
| `rltp-beekem` | authority log by the conflict matrix, keys from BeeKEM 0.4.0 | bench relay |
| `rltp-beekem-sichten`, `-logreplik` | the same with an enforcing service at the relay (class view or class log) | bench relay, enforcing |
| `rltp-beekem-pws` | the same on Portable Web Spaces (was-teaching-server 0.42) as blind storage | own server, Node only |
| `rltp-mls`, `rltp-mls-sichten` | the same candidate code, keys from MLS (OpenMLS 0.9.1) | bench relay |
| `consensual-mls-any-staged`, `-owner` | MLS without an authority log, the commit decides membership (room model) | bench relay |
| `klartext` | null candidate without encryption; shows that the bench detects faults | bench relay |

Run times are comparable only within a transport class: with an own server,
S9 is almost all waiting.

- `mehrgeraet-k0`: E15, the multi-device holder state. K0 is today's
  cut, one seed and no merge, the baseline that has to fail X1, X2, X3
  and X7. Further candidates (journal with pre-assigned rights, device
  sets with a delegation profile, soft limits) follow.

## Scenarios

- **S1 to S11** (`src/lab/scenarios.ts`): membership under conflict, devices
  per person, history, stolen state, a service at the relay.
- **T1 to T12** (`src/lab/traeger.ts`): the carrier as adversary (drop,
  reorder, duplicate, tamper, withhold, freeze, carrier switch, what the
  carrier reads).
- **T9, T10, Z1 to Z5** (`src/lab/zustellung.ts`): pair delivery over the
  wires plain envelope, TSP Rev 3 and DIDComm v2 (authcrypt, anoncrypt):
  lost receipt, device offline, what the carrier learns, carrier switch,
  multiple devices, foreign sender, wrong recipient key.
- **S9, S9b** (`src/lab/load.ts`): load, 30 members.
- **X1 to X12** (`src/lab/mehrgeraet/scenarios.ts`): several devices of
  one person against the target model of Trust 0.32 §8 and §6a: double
  consumption, budget, consent against decline, revocation against send,
  departure against replay, restore from backup, continuity across
  devices, enrollment, device revocation, long separation, delivery per
  device. Each runs with two devices and serially as the control.

## Layout

- `src/lab/types.ts`: the driver interface of the bench. This is **not**
  the port we are looking for, only as much as the scenarios need.
- `src/lab/world.ts`: simulated world with one Y.Doc per device and a
  store-and-forward network with partitions and fault injection.
- `src/lab/matrix.ts`: promises per port with the mapping scenario to
  promise; generates the matrix.
- `src/candidates/<id>/`: one candidate per directory, with `NOTES.md`.
  `rltp-beekem` is the experiment on the port cut: the authority log
  (`authority.ts`) decides membership, the key port (`keyport.ts`) delivers
  the keys, BeeKEM or MLS; the service at the relay is in `service.ts`.
- `src/candidates/zustellung/`: the wires of the delivery bench.
- `src/lab/mehrgeraet/`: the multi-device bench (E15): target model,
  holder device, world, scenarios.
- `rust/`: WebAssembly wrappers (`p2panda-wasm`, `beekem-wasm`, `mls-wasm`),
  built by `scripts/build-wasm.sh`; the bindings land under
  `src/candidates/*/pkg/`. `rust/mls-wasm/examples/vectors.rs` exchanges
  KeyPackage, Welcome, Commit and message as raw bytes with other MLS
  implementations (`cargo run --example vectors`).
- Candidates marked `nodeOnly` run only in Node and in CI; the browser page
  states the reason.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm wasm                       # build the Rust wrappers (Rust 1.96, wasm-bindgen 0.2.129)
pnpm server:fetch               # Subduction server (Rust binary) for Keyhive over ARK
pnpm test                       # bench tests
pnpm test:rust                  # native tests of the Rust wrappers
REPORT=1 pnpm vitest run report # result table of all candidates and matrix.md
pnpm dev                        # browser run, local
```

The browser page is published via GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
There, all runs can be started on a real device (S9, for example on
GrapheneOS) and the result copied as JSON.
